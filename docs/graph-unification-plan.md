# Graph Unification Plan — One Intraday‑Window Builder

## The goal, in plain English

For a long time the portfolio graphs have disagreed with themselves:

- **A — the spiky week.** The same recent period looks smooth on **1D** but
  spiky/sawtooth on **1W**.
- **B — overnight shape drift.** A settled day's 1D shape shifts slightly between
  the night view and the next morning, even though only the level (NAV) should
  move, not the shape.
- **C — the trailing tip.** At the right edge, **1D ends ticking up** while **1W
  ends ticking down** on the *same* close — which is impossible if they describe
  the same portfolio.

The root cause is simple once you see it: **1D and 1W are two different code
paths.** 1D draws dense intraday bars straight from the web provider. 1W draws
one coarse close per day and then *merges in a second, lower‑resolution data
source* (the desktop "blob") to try to add detail back. That merge is where the
spikes, the drift and the trailing‑tip mismatch all come from.

### The idea

Stop treating 1D and 1W as different things. **They are the same graph over a
different number of days.** So we build **one "intraday‑window" graph**:

- It fetches **5‑minute bars per symbol** over a window of `N` days.
- **"1D" is just `window(1 day)`. "1W" is just `window(5 days)`.** 2, 3 or 4‑day
  windows are the exact same builder for free.
- The "1D slice" of the 1W graph is therefore **literally the same bars** as the
  1D graph — not similar, identical.

This is affordable because the price provider (Twelve Data) **bills 1 credit per
symbol per request regardless of how many bars come back** — a dense 5‑day week
costs the same as a single day. So a single windowed fetch is a *superset* of the
1D fetch at *identical cost*: when you log in heavily outdated, **one fetch fills
both graphs.**

And because everything is now drawn from the same dense, per‑symbol intraday data,
the second data source (the blob merge) that caused the spikes is **removed
entirely**, not patched. We keep the blob only as an offline/edge fallback.

Finally, the **Python desktop app gets the same treatment at the same 5‑minute
density**, so neither app — and neither timeframe — can drift from the other.

### What is explicitly *not* changing

- The **update/polling orchestrator**, caching, reservation and back‑off — all
  untouched. We only change **what data is loaded** and the **bar type/settings**.
- **Breadcrumbs** stay as the live‑tail filler for the open session.
- The **provider‑disagreement / settle** machinery stays.
- Nothing is "frozen" at close — that was never the behaviour and isn't changing.

## Evidence (live API probes, 2026‑06‑30)

Probes run against the live Twelve Data and Tiingo keys:

| Finding | Result |
| --- | --- |
| TD `time_series interval=5min` + `start_date` over a week | Returns the **full 5 trading days** — `78 bars/day × 5 = 390 bars` — in **one call per symbol** |
| TD billing | **1 credit per symbol per request, regardless of bar count** (`prices.ts:460`) |
| TD coverage at 5min (one call) | Full (78/day): MSFT, VOO, VXUS, VT, VGK, VUG, VTV, VTI, IAUM, VWO. Near‑full: SCHK (74–78). Sparse: **DAX** (20–36/day) |
| Why DAX is sparse on TD | TD omits **no‑trade 5‑min buckets** for the thin Global X DAX ETF; the price info is identical to Tiingo's — Tiingo just forward‑fills empty buckets with synthetic flats |
| EUR/USD at 5min | Dense on **both** TD (~288/day) and Tiingo (~288/day) |
| 5‑min history depth | **~5 trading days** — exactly matches `DEFAULT_WEEK_SESSIONS = 5` (`week.ts:72`) |
| Rate limit | **8 calls/min** on the supplied TD key is real (a 10‑symbol batch returned HTTP 429) |

**Conclusion:** Twelve Data alone can self‑cover the entire 1W window at 5‑minute
density for the whole book in one call per symbol. Tiingo is an *optional*
backfill (DAX/SCHK) and is **not** needed for live FX (credit‑constrained). Thin
symbols are handled by the per‑symbol forward‑fill already present in
`reconstructSessionCurve`.

## Current state (verified against `main`)

### 1D — session pipeline
`buildLiveSessionCurve` (`live-graph.ts:680`) → `makePriceBarFetcher`
(`param:"intraday"`, 5‑min) over `sessionFxWindow` (today) →
`loadOrBuildSessionCurve` (`intraday.ts:456`) → per‑symbol bars in
`stored.bars[s]` → `reconstructSessionCurve` (`timeseries.ts:185`).

- Live tip: whole‑book **breadcrumb** spliced after the last bar while the market
  is open (`intraday.ts:699‑712`).
- After close: `capAtClose(points, closeMs)` filters `t > closeMs`
  (`intraday.ts:232‑234, 713‑718`).
- **Never merges the blob.** Clean and smooth.

### 1W — week pipeline
`buildLiveWeekCurve` (`live-graph.ts:751`) → `makePriceBarFetcher`
(`param:"daily"`, `interval:"1day"`, `outputsize ≈ 8`) → `loadOrBuildWeekCurve`
(`week.ts:431`): **one close per session per symbol** in `stored.bars[s]`.

- Per‑day enrichment (`week.ts:660‑723`) swaps each day's coarse close for fine
  1D intraday bars **read from that day's session cache** via
  `store.loadSession(day)` (`week.ts:674`) — but that cache only exists for days
  the dashboard watched live, so **older days stay one coarse point/day**.
- `reconstructSessionCurve` (`week.ts:725`), **then** `enrichWeekWithBlobSleeve`
  (app.ts) → `mergeSleeveSeries` (`market-sleeve.ts:180`), **then**
  `capWeekToSessionClose` (`week.ts:801`).

### The defect, exactly
`mergeSleeveSeries` agree‑branch (`market-sleeve.ts:221‑224`):

```ts
if (Math.abs(deltaFraction) <= tau) {
  // Agree — thicken the line with the union of both sources' true points.
  points.push(...tag(w, "both"), ...tag(b, "both"));
  counts.both += 1;
}
```

It **unions** web 5‑min points and blob 30‑min points whenever they agree within
`tau = 0.25%`. They agree but are not equal, so the blob sample sits offset from
the web line and, sorted by time, interleaves web/blob/web → **sawtooth = A**. The
EUR leg is doubly affected because the two sources carry different per‑instant FX.
The conditional tail pin `pinMergedTipToWebTip` (`market-sleeve.ts:305`) plus the
post‑merge cap seam produce the **trailing‑tip mismatch = C**. (The disagree‑branch
already keeps the blob authoritative and raises a `ReconciliationFlag` — that part
is fine.)

### Supporting systems (unchanged by this plan)
- **Blob** ships an **aggregate** market sleeve (`market_series`: FX‑free USD
  value + per‑instant `fx_eur_usd`), **not per‑symbol**; only the 1W builder
  consumes it.
- **Disagreement:** `resolveCloseCompleteness` (`close-completeness.ts`) — primary
  TD + secondary Tiingo; a symbol is **settled** when one source reaches the close
  *or* two sources agree 3×. Used by **both** 1D (`tol ≈ 1h`) and 1W
  (`tol ≈ 12h`). Provider‑agnostic; kept.
- **FX:** EUR/USD is just another symbol on the same price pipe
  (`makeFxFetcher`); applied per bar in `reconstructSessionCurve`
  (`timeseries.ts:127‑145, 211`). The live quote is stamped at **fetch time**
  (`quotes.ts:866` `const at = now()`).

---

## The changes

### C1 — 1W bar type/settings → intraday 5‑min over the window
`live-graph.ts:766‑801`: change the 1W fetcher from
`param:"daily" / interval:"1day" / outputsize≈8` to
`param:"intraday" / interval:"5min" / outputsize ≈ sessions·78 + pad` with
`startDate = week‑window start`. Now `stored.bars[s]` holds **dense 5‑min bars for
every window day**, feeding the same `reconstructSessionCurve`. The today‑slice of
1W becomes the same bars as 1D.

### C2 — Remove the blob merge from the live 1W path
Drop the `enrichWeekWithBlobSleeve` call and retire `mergeSleeveSeries` /
`calibrateSleeveBase` / `rebaseSleeveToWholeBook` / `pinMergedTipToWebTip` from
the live path. With C1 there is **no second aggregate to reconcile** → the union
sawtooth (**A**) and the pin/cap tail seam (**C**) disappear by construction.
This is why **no per‑symbol blob export is needed** — we delete the unifier rather
than perfect it.

### C3 — Tail unification
Once the merge and pin are gone, 1W uses the **same `capAtClose`** as 1D (it
already calls it internally via `capWeekToSessionClose`). No special tail logic
remains → **C** resolved.

### C4 — FX policy (no polling change)
Switch the 1W FX leg from daily to 5‑min (same pipe, mirrors C1) and stop
consuming the blob's `fx_eur_usd` (gone with C2). **Trust device‑pulled 5‑min
FX.** Do **not** change the FX **polling cadence**.

**FX must use the quote's own price, not the pull time.** Today the live EUR/USD
quote is stamped at fetch time (`quotes.ts:866`, `const at = now()`), which
mis‑times the FX point to when we happened to poll rather than to the rate it
represents. On web, use the **FX quote's reported price (and its own timestamp)**
as the live FX mark — not the local pull clock. This is the only intentional
change to live‑quote handling; the cadence is untouched.

### C5 — Shared per‑day store (answers "identical + carried forward")
Both views reconstruct from the **same per‑day session bars** via the **same**
`reconstructSessionCurve`, so the 1D slice of 1W is identical, not similar. The
carry‑forward already exists (`week.ts:674` reads each window day's session);
today's dense session persists per‑day and is read as a prior day tomorrow. We
just make **every** window day dense.

### C6 — Unify the fetch (answers "for outdated situations, one bar set")
The windowed 5‑min pull is a **strict superset** of the 1D pull at **identical
cost** (1 credit/symbol regardless of length). Collapse the two fetchers into one
windowed intraday fetcher feeding the shared per‑day store; each view is a slice:

- **Heavily outdated / fresh login:** one windowed fetch serves **both** 1D and
  1W — no separate 1D call.
- **Warm store, market open:** only today's slice is refreshed.

The orchestrator's timing/triggers are **untouched**; only *what* is loaded is
deduplicated. **Consequence:** the separate `WEEK_STORE_KEY` daily‑close cache
(`week.ts:639‑658`) and the `daily/1day` close‑completeness path **retire** — the
week reconstructs from the shared per‑day intraday store. This is the load‑bearing
deletion; it is gated behind the test suite.

### C7 — Reframe: it's just intraday‑window fetching
There is no "1D path" and "1W path" — there is **one intraday‑window builder
parameterized by `[start, end]`**. "1D" = `window(1 session)`, "1W" =
`window(5 sessions)`; 2–4‑day windows are the same builder/fetch/reconstruction
for free. **Bound:** 5‑min depth ≈ 5 trading days (probe ceiling) → the intraday
builder covers any range up to ~5 sessions at 5‑min; **beyond that the existing
long‑range/daily path** (`app.ts:8032`, interval steps up with window length)
takes over unchanged.

### C8 — Python parity at 5‑min
Collapse Python's `build_intraday_value_series` vs `build_week_value_series` into
**one range‑parameterized intraday builder at 5‑min**, sharing the per‑session
reconstruction, so Python graphs match web density and Python's own
1D‑slice‑of‑1W equals Python 1D. **If web is 5‑min, Python is 5‑min.**

## Orchestrator adaptation — one window-sized bar leg

The graph builder above (C1–C8) decides *how a graph is drawn*. This section is
the matching change to the **data orchestrator** — *what bars get pulled when*.
Because every bar is now just "intraday of length N", the orchestrator no longer
needs separate 1D and 1W bar concepts; it pulls **one bar leg of the length
needed**. Timing, cadence, reservation budget and back-off are **unchanged** —
only the bar-leg selection changes.

### Current state (verified against `main`)

`data-orchestrator.ts:planPull` + `freshness.ts:gradedPull` carry **two** bar legs
(`freshness.ts:49‑51`):

- **`weekBars`** (1W, one daily close per session, all symbols) lights **only** on
  the `heavily‑outdated` tier (`deviceDaysMissing > 1` AND `blobDaysOld > 1` →
  `allLegs`, `freshness.ts:134`) or a `reset`. Otherwise the 1W graph never pulls
  its own bars — it fills from the 1D session cache (`week.ts:674`) plus a tiny
  `≤4‑symbol targetedWeekBackfill` (`freshness.ts:191‑221`).
- **`dayBars`** (1D intraday): while the market is open, governed **solely** by the
  clock‑hour `:00` gate (`data-orchestrator.ts:246‑261`, `barClockHourDue`) — at
  most once per clock‑hour per symbol, first bar only >1h after open; between hours
  `dayBars` is forced off and **breadcrumbs** carry the line. Via the tier table,
  `dayBars` lights on `minorly‑outdated` (open ≥30 min, or closed).
- **`quotes`** = rolling TTL on the user's auto‑interval (5 min) = the heartbeat
  (`freshness.ts:272‑278`).
- **Verified:** a bar pull already updates the displayed mark/headline —
  `onFreshBars → primeQuotesFromGraphBars → primeQuotesFromBars`
  (`app.ts:7344‑7347, 7791‑7809`), NAV‑guarded by `navSafeBarsForPriming`. **"A bar
  subsumes the quote" is real today**, which is what makes a bar‑instead‑of‑quote
  round safe for the headline.

### O1 — Collapse the two bar legs into one window-sized `bars` leg
`weekBars` + `dayBars` become a single `bars` leg carrying a **window length**
(sessions / span). Per‑request flat billing (1 credit/symbol regardless of length)
makes the length just a number, not a separate concept.

### O2 — Collapse `heavily‑outdated` + `minorly‑outdated` into one `outdated` tier
Their only real difference was bar **count**, which is now just window length. The
merged `outdated` tier pulls `bars` over the **window of size needed** — length
derived continuously from the stale span / `deviceDaysMissing` (30‑min gap → tiny
fill; several days missing → up to the full ~5‑session window). A fresh‑login /
heavily‑outdated pull is then **one windowed bar pass that serves both 1D and 1W**
(no separate `weekBars` + `dayBars`). `relatively‑fresh` / `fresh` stay as the
quote‑cadence tiers (no bar pull).

### O3 — Replace the `:00` clock-hour gate with a 30-min staleness promotion (auto/startup only)
On **auto and startup rounds only** (never manual), the gate stops being a clock
alignment and becomes a **leg swap on the round that already fires** — never an
extra pull:

```
on a scheduled (auto/startup) round:
  if last real bar > 30 min old (or days missing):
      leg   = BARS over window(gap)   # the bar subsumes the quote
      quotes = SUPPRESSED             # do NOT also pull ~25 quotes
  else:
      leg   = QUOTES (heartbeat tip)
  + FX / NAV overlays unchanged
```

Rationale: ~25 symbols × (bars + quotes) at 8/min ≈ 6–7 min/round; **bars
INSTEAD‑OF quotes** keeps it to one ~3–4 min pass. Cadence while open becomes
~**5 quote rounds : 1 bar round**. The bar round ingests only **completed** slots
(excludes the in‑progress candle); the next 5‑min quote round restores the live
tip.

### O4 — Split the manual controls: global = quote, per-graph button = bars
Manual behaviour is split into two distinct controls:

- **(a) The existing global refresh button → always a QUOTE round, no matter
  what.** No 30‑min bar promotion on manual. Its single job is the **freshest live
  price on demand**; it never repulls bars.
- **(b) A new per‑graph refresh button next to *each* graph** (one by 1D, one by
  1W). Clicking it **repulls bars for the window currently in view only**:
  - **1D button → `window(today's session)`**
  - **1W button → `window(full ~5‑session week)`**

  This is the explicit, **view‑scoped** "redraw the body from fresh bars" control.
  The pulled bars feed the headline via the verified `primeQuotesFromGraphBars`
  pipeline, so it refreshes price as a side effect too — but it is **bars‑only**
  (no separate quote round). Scope is exactly the visible timeframe, so a 1D click
  is cheap (today) while a 1W click pulls the whole window.

### O5 — `targetedWeekBackfill` absorbed
The window‑sized pull already covers each symbol's missing settled days, so the
`≤4‑symbol targetedWeekBackfill` is absorbed by O1/O2 → **retire**, or keep as a
bounded safety net (leaning retire).

### Net orchestrator brain
```
AUTO / STARTUP round:
  if bars stale (>30 min) or days missing -> BARS over window(needed), quotes OFF
  else                                     -> QUOTES heartbeat
GLOBAL manual button   -> QUOTES round, always
PER-GRAPH button (1D/1W) -> BARS over window(in view), bars-only
(+ FX / NAV overlays; reservation 8/min + breaker bind all)
```

**Explicitly unchanged:** the 5‑min quote heartbeat itself, FX/NAV overlays,
manual‑relevance forcing, the reservation budget (8/min TD cap), and the 429
breaker.

---

## What stays (explicit)

- **Breadcrumbs** — unchanged; still the live‑tail filler in both views
  (`intraday.ts:699‑712`, `week.ts:758‑778`). They simply matter less for the body
  once it is dense.
- **Blob loading** — kept as springboard/initial paint **and offline/edge
  fallback only** (no longer a live merge source). If a window day's 5‑min pull
  can't reach (offline, or the oldest edge beyond depth), fall back to that day's
  **daily close** — a fallback, never a blended merge.
- **Disagreement** — keep `resolveCloseCompleteness` (TD primary + Tiingo
  secondary). 1W simply moves from daily granularity to the intraday granularity
  1D already uses. Thin symbols (DAX) rely on the per‑symbol forward‑fill already
  in `reconstructSessionCurve`.
- **Orchestrator / polling / caching** — untouched (`regenerateOnly` redraw path,
  store, reservation, back‑off).
- **No‑freeze** — already the existing behaviour (`capAtClose` only *filters*
  post‑close); not a change.

---

## How this kills the three symptoms

| Symptom | Mechanism removed/added | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A** — 1W spiky | C1 + C2: dense per‑symbol bars, no two‑aggregate union merge | sawtooth gone |
| **B** — overnight shape drift | C5: same per‑day bars + same builder; settled days stop being reshaped by a second source | only level moves, never shape |
| **C** — 1D‑up / 1W‑down tail | C2 + C3: same builder, same today bars, no pin/cap seam | trailing tip identical |

---

## Cost / risk

- 1W refresh ≈ 17 credits (1/symbol; dense week = same as one day). The existing
  orchestrator already gates *when* — no budget‑regime change.
- **Exact depth fit:** window = 5 sessions vs 5‑min depth = 5 sessions has no
  margin at the oldest edge → the C2 daily‑close fallback covers a
  holiday‑shortened or edge miss.
- Removing the blob merge and the weekly daily‑close cache is the largest
  deletion → gated behind tests (`market-sleeve.test.ts` contract flips from
  "union/thicken" to "no live merge").

---

## Build order — tracks & groups

Work splits into **three tracks that run in parallel**. Within a track, **groups
are sequential**. The **Main track** carries the dependency spine (its groups must
go in order); the **Python** and **Web‑UI** tracks run alongside it, with one
integration point noted.

### MAIN TRACK (web graph + orchestrator) — groups are sequential

- **Group 1 — Foundation (fixes A/B/C).** `C1 → C2 → C3`, with `C4` alongside.
  Strictly ordered internally: C1 (1W draws dense 5‑min bars) before C2 (remove
  the blob merge — no second aggregate left to reconcile) before C3 (tail drops to
  1D's `capAtClose`); C4 (FX → 5‑min, FX‑quote‑price‑not‑pull‑time, drop blob FX)
  rides alongside C2/C3 in the same builder. **This group alone eliminates the
  three symptoms.**
- **Group 2 — Unify fetch & store.** `C5 · C6 · C7`. One windowed `[start,end]`
  intraday fetcher + shared per‑day store; retire the `daily/1day` week cache.
  **Must follow Group 1** — can't dedup the 1W path until it already draws intraday
  bars and the blob merge is deleted.
- **Group 3 — Orchestrator.** `O1 → (O2 · O3 · O5)`. One window‑sized `bars` leg
  (O1) gates the single `outdated` tier (O2), the 30‑min auto/startup promotion
  (O3) and the absorbed backfill (O5). **Must follow Group 2** — the "pull a bar of
  the size needed" capability only exists once the windowed fetcher does.

### PYTHON TRACK — parallel, start anytime

- **C8** — mirror the design in the Python desktop app at 5‑min density.
  Independent codebase, shares only the frozen design (zero shared code with the
  TS path), so it runs start‑to‑finish alongside the Main track.

### WEB‑UI TRACK — parallel, start anytime

- **O4(a)** — global manual button becomes a pure **quote** round. Trivial, no
  dependencies.
- **O4(b)** — new **per‑graph refresh button** (1D / 1W) that repulls bars for the
  in‑view window. The button UI can be built anytime; its bars‑repull action
  **wires into the windowed fetcher delivered by Main Group 2** (the one
  cross‑track integration point).

### The one hard rule
Main track **Group 1 → 2 → 3 is strictly sequential**. The Python track and the
Web‑UI track float free in parallel, with O4(b)'s data wiring as the only
dependency back onto Main Group 2.
