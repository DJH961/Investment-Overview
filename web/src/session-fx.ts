/**
 * How EUR/USD FX is wired into the value graphs across the market-hours boundary.
 *
 * The book is **USD-booked** (spot prices arrive in USD) but the owner lives in
 * the euro zone, so the EUR view of the portfolio re-marks at the live EUR/USD
 * spot. FX trades ~24h while the US equity session is only 09:30–16:00 ET, so
 * the EUR value keeps drifting **after the market has closed** even though every
 * security price is frozen at its settled close.
 *
 * That after-hours drift must be handled differently per graph:
 *
 *   - The **1D** and **1W** curves draw a *market-day trajectory*. Once the
 *     session has shut they should sit still — re-marking them at every
 *     after-hours FX tick would shift the whole euro line up and down overnight,
 *     which is not something that happened *during* the trading day. So while the
 *     market is closed these curves are anchored to the **session-close FX**
 *     ({@link graphAnchorFx}), frozen for the night.
 *   - The longer **history** graphs (1M/3M/…/All, the equity curve) and the
 *     headline total always value at the **live** after-hours spot, so the euro
 *     figure the user sees is genuinely current.
 *
 * The gap between those two — the headline EUR total (live FX) minus the
 * session-close EUR total (frozen FX) — is exactly the *overnight* FX P/L, which
 * {@link fxEffectSplit} isolates from the in-session FX move so the user can see
 * what shifted during the trading day versus what changed overnight.
 *
 * ## The "today" cutoff
 *
 * Every "today" signal on the hero — the price move badge, the FX `% today`
 * ({@link fxTodayDeviationPct}) and this market-hours/overnight split — resets at
 * the **prior NYSE session close (16:00 ET)**, the same clock the rest of the
 * dashboard already calls "today". So the market-hours slice spans *prior close →
 * this session's close* and the overnight slice spans *this session's close →
 * live spot*; the moment the next session opens the overnight slice folds back
 * into a single live "today" move. The settled FX baseline we measure that move
 * from is the provider's `previousClose` (its daily settle is the practical proxy
 * for the prior session close — the only always-available dated FX anchor).
 *
 * ## Surviving a market-closed / empty / not-live-at-close start
 *
 * The running session-close rate is captured live (see {@link recordSessionCloseFx}),
 * but the app may simply **not be open at 16:00 ET** — over a weekend, or on a
 * cold start from wiped storage. The two consumers degrade differently so that a
 * missing capture is *protected*, never fabricated:
 *
 *   - The **1D/1W graph freeze** ({@link graphAnchorFx}) must still hold the EUR
 *     curve still overnight, so when no live close was captured it falls back to
 *     the settled `previousClose` — a real, stable, non-drifting rate (on a
 *     weekend it *is* the session's close) — and only then to the live rate. This
 *     is precisely the not-live scenario, where the app was absent during the
 *     session so no capture exists.
 *   - The **attribution split** ({@link fxEffectSplit}) stays honest: it needs a
 *     genuine session close to draw the market-hours/overnight boundary. The app
 *     resolves that close from the session's own FX bars where possible (a real,
 *     dated rate that exists even on a cold start), and only otherwise from the
 *     live capture; with neither it returns `null` (the UI shows nothing) rather
 *     than blaming the whole move on "overnight".
 *
 * All maths is pure {@link Decimal} (no DOM, no storage); the two tiny
 * localStorage helpers at the bottom are the only side-effecting part and are
 * guarded so they never throw in a private-mode / storage-less context.

 * market-day trajectory does not slide with overnight FX:
 *
 *   1. the live-captured `sessionCloseFx` (the rate as the session settled) when
 *      we held the app open through the close;
 *   2. else the settled `settledPrevFx` (the provider's `previousClose`) — a
 *      real, non-drifting rate that, on a weekend / cold start, *is* the session
 *      close, so the freeze still works when the app was **not live** at 16:00 ET
 *      or is rebuilding from empty storage;
 *   3. else, as a last resort, the live rate — the same behaviour as before this
 *      freezing existed.
 *

 * liveFx` fallback in {@link graphAnchorFx} (and the equivalent anchor in

 * stale mid-session value (see scenarios C/F in the 1D-graph investigation). The
 * two tracks differ only in how close to 16:00 ET their last genuine bar lands,
 * which is exactly what `toleranceMs` expresses:
 *
 *   - **FX** (`toleranceMs = 0`): EUR/USD trades on past the 16:00 ET equity
 *     close, so a track fetched once the session shut always carries a bar **at
 *     or after** the close — the presence of one is the exact "the close itself
 *     is captured" signal (see {@link sessionFxBarsComplete}).
 *   - **Price** (`toleranceMs ≈ one bar interval`): the equity feed stops at the
 *     close, so a fully-fetched session's *last* bar sits within one bar interval
 *     **before** 16:00 ET (e.g. a 15:55 five-minute bar, or a 15:00–16:00 hourly
 *     bar). Allowing one interval of slack therefore reads a whole session as
 *     complete while still flagging a stale partial-day fetch (the 14:00 tail in
